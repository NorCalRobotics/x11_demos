**X11 Python/Tk Demos by NorCal Robotics**

**Moving Box Demo**
This is a demo X11 program written in Python (that uses Tk), designed to showcase a basic graphical application structure and serve as a template for developing more complex X11 applications.

**Starfield Demo**
This is a demo X11 program written in Python (that uses Tk), designed to launch a window displaying an animation depicting travel through a starfield.

**Running the Application:**

Ensure you have python and requirements listed in `requirements.txt` installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
Once compiled, execute either of the programs using the following commands:

```bash
python stars.py
```

```bash
python moving_box.py
```

This will launch a window displaying an animation depicting travel through a starfield.

**Project Structure:**

The project consists of the following files:

- `stars.py`: The starfield source code file implementing the X11 window creation, graphics drawing, and animation logic.
- `moving_box.py`: The moving box source code file implementing the X11 window creation, graphics drawing, and animation logic.
- `requirements.txt` python modules required.
- `README.md` This file.

**Project Purpose:**

This demo serves as a foundational template for building more intricate X11 applications. It demonstrates essential concepts like window creation, event handling, and basic graphics drawing using Xlib functions.
